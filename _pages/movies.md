<h2>2020: Across the Adriatic (Croatia)</h2>

Embark on an exhilarating journey with our adventurous Slovak paddling expedition documented in this thrilling movie. For 17 days, we paddled sea kayaks through the outer islands, covering over 600 kilometers from Rijeka to Dubrovnik in Croatia. Along the way, we immersed ourselves in the vibrant Mediterranean wildlife. Facing challenges like heat waves, the formidable Neverin windstorm, enduring days of the relentless Bura wind, and contending with a scarcity of drinking water, this expedition was a test of courage and endurance.
