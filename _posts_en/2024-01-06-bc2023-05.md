description: The final third part of the story about an adventure in the Arctic part of the Atlantic Ocean. See how I circumnavigated the Norwegian Lofoten archipelago in marathon style on a sea kayak. Discover the beauty of pristine nature. Paddling after sunset. The next four days we paddled in rain and fog, a reminder that we were beyond the Arctic Circle.

This expedition hasn't ended yet, but it has already pushed my comfort zone into uncharted territories. I've realized again that human limits are just something we create out of fear deep in our minds. We are afraid of the unknown. On this expedition, it was unknown people, extreme paddling, constant rain, and cold.

On one of the most beautiful beaches I've ever seen, I managed not only to recharge my batteries but also started to feel at home. This epic Arctic marathon continued with typical Norwegian weather - cold, rain, fog, and wind. However, the ocean was pleasant. It was like running through the home stretch victoriously. I felt maximum satisfaction. We paddled to the cars in the rain and fog for another four days.

After a day of active rest, wandering through the mountain terrain above the photogenic Kvalvika, we set out to the ocean without hurry and were glad that we only had to pack dry things. Along the coast, we discovered several nice caves. The untouched landscape provided immense energy. I enjoyed the movement of the ocean and absorbed the beauty of the surroundings.

We needed to replenish our water, so we decided to stop at the harbor of Ramberg, where we had coffee and bought some fruit. It was like finding an oasis in the desert. However, the reality was different. We were still on an expedition. This area wasn't covered on our map. There were no known places for free camping. All day long, we couldn't find a place to camp. We couldn't even find a place after sunset.

Exhausting paddling and a light show at sea. The polar day had ended, but there was no complete darkness even at night. When we finally arrived at the Arctic surfing beach of Unstad, the rain turned into a proper downpour. We paddled more than 50 km. Carrying the kayaks and setting up the tent in the storm took the last bit of my energy. It was an unusually warm night. I remember sitting naked in the tent full of wet and cold things. All that was left was to crawl into the sleeping bag and close my eyes.

We were lucky that we started the morning without rain. For a whole two hours. We were on the water briefly. Just 16 km and almost without wind. There was complete fog. We paddled only with the help of navigation I had attached to the kayak. We stayed on an island where we found another ruin of an old house. There was nowhere to go, and I rested in the tent until the next day.

The last two days were equally gray and rainy. 30 and 36 km. I felt the end of the expedition approaching. It was a great feeling. We slept in tents for the last time in the settlement of Laukvik. The final stage of paddling was made pleasant by a curious whale. The incredible became reality. We circumnavigated the Lofoten on sea kayaks. An indescribable rush of emotions. In the end, everything seemed easier. You realize that very little is needed for a satisfied life.

Although it may not seem like it, we were incredibly lucky. Despite the dramatic conditions, we managed to paddle every day at a marathon pace with a smile on our faces. The time we saved was used for high-mountain hiking. This time on foot, without the kayak. All that was left was to get home. I spent more than 3500 kilometers driving, thinking about how I would meet my family and friends.

I also thought about the next big adventure. After such an expedition, I felt that I could go anywhere on a kayak. I told myself that I would do everything to organize another expedition that would build on the experiences gained in Norway and bring even greater challenges. I prepared for it for another two years.

Next time in this series, we will move to the waters of the northern Pacific, where we will sail for a month with whales and seals in the almost uninhabited part of British Columbia between the ports of Prince Rupert and Telegraph Cove. We will explore the area also known as the 'Great Bear Rainforest', larger than half of Slovakia. A place where endless mountains and the even larger Pacific Ocean meet. The forest is still ruled by large predators like bears, wolves, and cougars.
