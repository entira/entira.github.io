The end of this summer is here and in our latitude it is the last chance for an adventure in countryside with a nice weather during the day and not too cold  nights. I decided to take an advantage of months of practice on water with a sea kayak. I chose the longest river in the European Union, the second longest river in Europe and the 30th longest river in the world. No need to go far away, it is our Danube. A stretch of approximately 270 kilometers connects the capitals of three neighboring countries:  Vienna, Bratislava and Budapest, Hungary. That will be our voyage.

I planned this voyage for 5 days.  The Danube flows up to Bratislava pretty fast and we are trying to go to Dobrohošť even if a very good weather forecast will not be a reality. Then we will transfer kayaks into the old Danube, which is much nicer.  Except a ferry there are no large ships that destroy a peaceful sleep. There is a large wooded island in the vicinity  of the transfer point,  which makes a perfect place to pitch a camp.
