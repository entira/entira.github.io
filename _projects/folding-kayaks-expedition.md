<h2>Intro</h2>

Join the next adventure on traditional folding kayaks made of modern materials. A whole expedition packed only in backpacks able to reach any place in the world. Paddling among coral reefs, surrounded by tropical rainforest somewhere in Southeast Asia in the spring of 2023.

I'm looking for adventurous, experienced paddlers who like challenges. We will try to find and explore places where no one has ever been on a sea kayak before.

The first challenge is to identify such a place and figure out how to get there. I suggest Southeast Asia. I've organized two expeditions here. In Thailand and the Philippines. In the tropics, we don't need almost any clothes or bulky sleeping bags.  It is possible to do longer routes without resupply. We like it longer, more remote and wild. 

The next challenge will be to plan the whole expedition. Draw a expedition map, identify possible water sources, campsites, and all the places we want to explore deeper. Study the local wildlife, habits, culture, and climate. Consider all the risks to be prepared for every eventuality.

**I would especially appreciate a paddler who would like to shoot unique aerial drone footage from the sea and land that would become part of an expedition film.**
