Embark on an expedition guided by a seasoned sea kayaker, who has journeyed from Arctic waters to the vibrant depths of tropical paradises. From enduring the icy challenges of British Columbia's Great Bear Rainforest to paddling amidst the kaleidoscope of life in Southeast Asia's coral reefs, my competence spans diverse terrains. I've orchestrated international voyages, including the successful circumnavigation of the rugged Lofoten islands. Join me on an upcoming adventure, where traditional folding kayaks, designed for modern exploration, will navigate the warmth of the tropics in 2024 and 2025. This is your chance to be part of an unforgettable, competency-backed expedition.

Are you an intrepid, seasoned paddler who thrives on conquering new frontiers? If so, we have an extraordinary proposition: together, we'll chart unexplored waters on sea kayaks, venturing where none have ventured before.

Our inaugural challenge: pinpointing the perfect location and devising a route to reach it. My recommendation? Southeast Asia, a region I've successfully led two expeditions in - one in Thailand, the other in the Philippines. In the tropics, the need for bulky gear diminishes, allowing us to pursue longer, more remote routes with minimal resupply requirements.

Once we've settled on our destination, the real work begins. Planning the entire expedition demands meticulous attention. From sketching out a detailed expedition map to identifying potential water sources and optimal campsites, every facet must be meticulously considered. Our mission: to delve deep into uncharted territory, understanding the local ecosystem, customs, culture, and climate. And of course, it goes without saying that we'll be poised for any unforeseen challenges that may arise. This is an adventure for the daring, the curious, and those who thrive on the thrill of the unknown. Are you up for the challenge?
